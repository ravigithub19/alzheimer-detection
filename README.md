## Methodology

The workflow of the proposed model follows the steps outlined below:

1. **Data Collection**:  
   Data is sourced from well-known datasets such as ADNI and OASIS, containing cognitive test scores, biomarkers, and demographic information.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   The collected data is preprocessed to convert its content into numerical format, ensuring compatibility with ML algorithms. This step includes data cleaning, normalization, and handling missing values.

3. **Feature Extraction**:  
   Key attributes from the preprocessed data are selected to form feature sets, which are then used for training the ML models.

4. **ML Algorithm Implementation**:  
   The extracted features are categorized into different stages of Alzheimer's disease using various ML techniques, including:  
   - Random Forest (RF) Classifier  
   - Support Vector (SV) Classifier  
   - Decision Tree (DT) Classifier  
   - Gradient Boosting Classifier (an ensemble technique)  
   - K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Classifier  

5. **Prediction & Result**:  
   The trained models are utilized to make predictions, categorizing the data into different stages of Alzheimer’s. The results are aimed at aiding the treatment and consistent management of the disease.
